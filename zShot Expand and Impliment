Solution Plan
Since Zshot is a Telegram dApp (likely a bot) with basic features, and assuming it operates on the TON blockchain (common for Telegram-related crypto projects), we can build a new or enhanced Telegram bot to manage ZAI tokens more effectively. Here’s the approach:
Create or Extend a Telegram Bot  
Use Telegram’s Bot API to either improve Zshot (if its source is accessible) or create a new bot that replicates and expands its functionality.

Add Core Features  
Sending Tokens: Allow users to transfer ZAI to other addresses.

Swapping Tokens: Enable swapping ZAI for other tokens via a decentralized exchange (DEX).

Buying/Selling: Retain the existing buy and sell functions.

Integrate with the TON Blockchain  
Use a TON blockchain library (e.g., ton-client-py) to execute token transactions.

For swapping, connect to a TON-based DEX or liquidity pool.

User Interaction  
Implement bot commands (e.g., /send, /swap) for a simple, text-based interface.

Use wallet connections (e.g., TON Connect) for secure transaction signing, avoiding the need for the bot to handle private keys.

Make It User-Friendly  
Add feedback messages, price info, or confirmation prompts to improve usability.

Since you described Zshot as “trash” due to its limited features, this solution aims to make it more functional and practical, ensuring your ZAI tokens aren’t just sitting there unused.
Implementation Code
Below is a sample implementation using Python and the python-telegram-bot library. This code sets up a Telegram bot with the desired features. Note that blockchain-specific interactions (e.g., TON integration) are placeholders, as they require additional libraries and setup specific to ZAI and the TON ecosystem. I’ll explain how to expand those parts afterward.

How It Works
Setup  
The bot is created using a token from Telegram’s BotFather (you’d need to get one via @BotFather on Telegram).

Commands like /start and /help provide a user-friendly entry point.

Sending Tokens (/send)  
Example: /send 10 ZAI to @username

The bot parses the amount, token (ZAI), and recipient, then prompts you to confirm the transfer via your connected wallet (e.g., TON Connect).

Once confirmed, it uses the TON blockchain to send the tokens.

Swapping Tokens (/swap)  
Example: /swap 10 ZAI for TON

The bot calculates an estimated output (e.g., via a DEX), shows you the details, and asks for wallet confirmation to execute the swap.

Buying/Selling (/buy, /sell)  
These retain Zshot’s existing functionality (placeholders here since I don’t have Zshot’s exact code).

Example: /buy 5 ZAI or /sell 5 ZAI.

Error Handling  
The bot checks inputs and provides feedback if something’s wrong (e.g., insufficient balance or bad syntax).

Expanding the Blockchain Integration
The code includes placeholders for TON blockchain interactions because they require additional setup:
Install a TON Library  
Use ton-client-py (Python) or a similar SDK. Install with:
bash

pip install ton-client-py

You’ll need to configure it with your TON node endpoint.

Sending Tokens  
Replace the send_command TODO with something like:
python

from tonclient.types import CallSet
from tonclient.client import TonClient

# Initialize TON client (configure with your endpoint)
ton_client = TonClient(...)

# Prepare transfer call (example assumes ZAI is a TON token)
call_set = CallSet(function_name="transfer", input={
    "to": recipient_address,
    "value": int(amount * 10**9)  # Adjust for token decimals
})
# Execute via wallet (requires wallet connection logic)

Swapping Tokens  
Integrate with a TON DEX (e.g., TON Swap). Example:
python

# Check liquidity and execute swap (simplified)
swap_details = ton_client.query_dex("ZAI", to_token, amount)
call_set = CallSet(function_name="swap", input={
    "from_token": "ZAI",
    "to_token": to_token,
    "amount": int(amount * 10**9)
})

Wallet Connection  
Use TON Connect or a similar protocol to link users’ wallets. The bot would send a confirmation request (e.g., a button or link) that opens the wallet app for signing.

Getting Started
Create the Bot  
Go to @BotFather on Telegram, type /newbot, and follow the steps to get a token. Replace "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN" in the code.

Run the Bot  
Install dependencies: pip install python-telegram-bot

Run the script: python your_script.py

Test It  
Open Telegram, find your bot, and try commands like /start, /send 10 ZAI to @test, or /swap 5 ZAI for TON.

Add Blockchain Logic  
Once the basic bot works, integrate the TON-specific code as outlined above.

Why This Solves Your Problem
Unsticks Your ZAI: The /send command lets you move ZAI to other wallets, freeing them from Zshot.

Adds Functionality: The /swap command makes ZAI more useful by enabling trades with other tokens.

Keeps What Works: Buy and sell features stay, so you don’t lose existing capabilities.
