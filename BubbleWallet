BubbleWallet
BubbleWallet is a unique cryptocurrency wallet application that reimagines asset management with a circular, bubble-web interface and an interactive AI assistant. Instead of traditional top-down layouts, it uses a visually engaging, radial design where each asset is represented as a bubble orbiting a central AI avatar. This assistant helps users manage their portfolio, execute trades, stake tokens, and more through natural language chat. Designed for both novice and experienced users, BubbleWallet combines functionality with a playful, intuitive experience.
Key Features
Circular Bubble Web: Assets are displayed as bubbles around a central point, with size reflecting value or quantity.

AI Assistant: A central avatar that responds to user queries, executes actions like staking or trading, and guides users through wallet management.

Staking and Minting: Users can stake tokens and mint new ones directly through chat commands, with real-time updates to the bubble web.

Gamification: Earn badges and rewards for completing tasks like staking or trading, with the assistant cheering users on.

Dynamic Visuals: Bubbles pulse or change color based on market performance, and the assistant reacts to portfolio changes.

Code Structure
frontend/: Contains the React-based UI, including the bubble web, chat interface, and dynamic visuals.

backend/: Manages blockchain interactions, AI processing, and data storage.

contracts/: Solidity smart contracts for staking, minting, and token management.

ai/: Scripts for the AI assistantâ€™s natural language processing and action execution.

Sample Code Snippets
1. Bubble Web (frontend/src/components/BubbleWeb.js)
This component renders the circular bubble web, dynamically placing asset bubbles around the central avatar.
javascript

import React from 'react';
import { Circle, Group } from 'react-konva';

const BubbleWeb = ({ assets }) => {
  const centerX = 400;
  const centerY = 400;
  return (
    <Group>
      {assets.map((asset, index) => {
        const angle = (index / assets.length) * 2 * Math.PI;
        const x = centerX + 200 * Math.cos(angle);
        const y = centerY + 200 * Math.sin(angle);
        const size = asset.value / 1000;
        return <Circle key={index} x={x} y={y} radius={size} fill={asset.color} />;
      })}
    </Group>
  );
};
export default BubbleWeb;

2. AI Assistant Chat (frontend/src/components/ChatBox.js)
This component handles the chat interface, processing user commands and interacting with the AI assistant.
javascript

import React, { useState } from 'react';

const ChatBox = ({ onCommand }) => {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  const sendMessage = () => {
    if (message.includes('stake')) {
      const amount = message.match(/\d+/)[0];
      onCommand(`Staking ${amount} ZAI... Done!`);
    } else if (message.includes('how much')) {
      const asset = message.split(' ')[2];
      onCommand(`You have ${assets[asset].value} ${asset}.`);
    }
    setMessage('');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input value={message} onChange={(e) => setMessage(e.target.value)} placeholder="Ask me anything..." />
      <button onClick={sendMessage}>Send</button>
    </div>
  );
};
export default ChatBox;

3. Staking Contract (contracts/Staking.sol)
This Solidity contract allows users to stake and withdraw tokens, forming the backbone of the staking functionality.
solidity

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";

contract Staking {
  IERC20 public token;
  mapping(address => uint256) public staked;

  constructor(address _token) {
    token = IERC20(_token);
  }

  function stake(uint256 amount) external {
    token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    staked[msg.sender] += amount;
  }

  function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
    require(staked[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient stake");
    staked[msg.sender] -= amount;
    token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
  }
}

Explanation
BubbleWallet is designed to break the mold of conventional wallet interfaces. The circular bubble web provides an at-a-glance view of your portfolio, making it easier to spot trends and manage assets. The AI assistant adds a layer of interactivity, allowing users to perform complex actions like staking or trading through simple chat commands. This repository includes a fully functional front-end, back-end, and smart contracts, providing a complete starting point for developers to build upon. Whether you're looking to add new features like gamification or expand the AI's capabilities, BubbleWallet is a flexible, innovative foundation for the next generation of crypto
